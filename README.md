##Damerau-Levenstein spellchecker

Compare two words: `dog` and `dgo`

`damerau_levenstein -w dog dgo`

and the result should be like this:

	dog          dgo  1

Compare word `possible` against words found from the file `web2`.

Command `damerau_levenstein -i -d 1 -f web2 possible` will do it.

The results:

	Will fix this soon, hopefully :)


##Use cases?
Well, my first though was to make a shell spell checker / auto corrector /
quick switch cwd tool that could deal with typos. With the current
implementation you can give a shell history as a parameter and it can propose
correction. Still many important things lacking for appropriate use.

##Other info
There might be silly bugs laying around because its non maturity. Feel free to
report them.

This program is BSD licensed.

Better documentation coming near future.

##TODO
Apparently my Vim configuration in Linux had the wrong settings because the C
code looks so ugly. Sorry for headache.

Separate .c to .c and .h probably.

Store words to tree for more efficient search and save it to disk.
